# Discord-Nitro-Generator
a working 11 line Discord Nitro Generator script coded in python.

Generating The Nitro Giftcodes:
step 1: copy the script.

step 2: paste the script into python (replit works fine aswell if you select python as language).

step 3: edit the number in line 5 of the script that is in brackets to whatever amount of nitro giftcodes you want to generate.

step 4: run the script.

step 5: check the "output.txt" file that was made after you ran the script for the generated nitro giftcodes.

step 6: copy & paste the nitro giftcodes one by one into a discord server (recommended to make your own).



Using The AFK Auto Typer:
 copy & pasting codes one by one might get boring so i coded an AFK Auto Typer in AutoHotKey.

step 1: install AutoHotKey from the official website: https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ 

step 2: download the script to my AFK Auto Typer from linkvertise: https://link-center.net/391674/afk-auto-typer

step 3: copy the nitro giftcodes generated in step 5 of "Generating The Nitro Giftcodes:"

step 4: paste the generated nitro giftcodes into the Auto Typer as shown under this step:
